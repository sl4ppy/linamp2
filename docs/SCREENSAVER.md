# Screensaver Feature

## Overview

The screensaver activates after 5 minutes of idle time (no playback and no user interaction). It randomly selects one of 7 themed clock faces each time it activates: 6 analog watch styles and a neon digital clock. All analog themes feature a circular bouncing dial to prevent burn-in. Any mouse click, key press, or music playback immediately deactivates it.

## Clock Themes

### Analog Themes

All analog themes render a circular watch dial that bounces around the screen. Each theme defines its own hand shapes, tick markers, colors, and decorative elements via the `ClockTheme` struct in `clockthemes.h`.

| Theme | Dial | Hands | Ticks | Accents |
|-------|------|-------|-------|---------|
| **Luxury** | Deep blue | Gold tapered hour, gold sword minute | Triangle cardinals, rect hours, line minutes | Green lume dots, gold rim, 1 decorative ring |
| **Aviator** | Dark charcoal | White sword hour+minute, orange needle second | Rect at all hours, line minutes | Arabic numerals at 12/3/6/9, orange accents |
| **Diver** | Black | Mercedes hour, sword minute, needle second w/ counterweight | Triangle at 12/3/6/9, luminous dots at hours | Green lume dots, 2 decorative rings |
| **Minimalist** | Pure black | Thin needle for all 3 hands | Small dots at hours only, no minute ticks | Muted colors, subtle breathing, minimal rim |
| **Chronograph** | Dark gray | Dauphine hour+minute, needle second w/ counterweight | Rect indices, line minutes | 3 decorative rings, tachymeter outer ring, yellow second hand |
| **Neon Retro** | Transparent dark | Alpha/leaf outlines (no fill), needle second | Diamond cardinals+hours, dot minutes | Hue-cycling colors, outline-only rendering, 1.5x glow, Arabic numerals |

**Hand shapes** (`HandShape` enum): Tapered, Sword, Mercedes (circle cutout), Dauphine (diamond cross-section), Needle, Breguet (moon-hole), Alpha/Leaf (sinusoidal bulge).

**Tick shapes** (`TickShape` enum): Line, Rect, Triangle, Dot, Diamond.

**Glow-in-the-dark rendering:** Elements are painted to a glow buffer sized to the dial bounding box at 1/4 resolution, blurred with a 2-pass box blur approximating Gaussian, then composited as a soft glow layer underneath the sharp full-resolution core. Glow intensity is configurable per theme (e.g., Neon gets 1.5x, Minimalist gets 0.3x).

### Digital Theme

A floating clock displaying time (12-hour with blinking colon), AM/PM, and the current date. The text block bounces off the screen edges like a DVD screensaver.

Rendered using 3-layer neon glow via QPainterPath strokes:
1. Outer glow — wide pen, low alpha
2. Mid glow — medium pen, medium alpha
3. Core — narrow filled path, white-tinted color

Fonts: DejaVu Sans Mono for time (44px * UI_SCALE), DejaVu Sans for AM/PM (18px) and date (13px).

## Shared Effects

- **Rainbow hue cycling**: Full 360-degree cycle in ~60 seconds (0.2 degrees per frame at 30fps). Only applied to Neon Retro theme for analog; always active for digital.
- **Breathing**: Sinusoidal intensity modulation, amount configurable per theme (0.1–0.3)
- **Bouncing**: All clock modes bounce off screen edges to prevent OLED/LCD burn-in

## Architecture

```

  clockthemes.h       # Theme data structures, hand polygon generators, 7 theme definitions
  screensaverview.h   # Class definition with ClockMode enum, themed drawing methods

  mainwindow.cpp      # activateScreenSaver(), deactivateScreenSaver()
```

### Theme System

`ClockTheme` (in `clockthemes.h`) is a header-only struct containing:
- `ClockColors` — all colors (dial, hands, ticks, numerals, lume, center pin, rim, decorative rings)
- `HandConfig` — shape, length, width for each hand + counterweight options
- `TickConfig` — shape and size for cardinal/hour/minute ticks + luminous dots toggle
- Rendering flags: `isDigital`, `outlineOnly`, `hueCycling`, `glowIntensity`, `breatheAmount`
- Dial properties: `dialRadiusFraction`, `decorativeRings`, `tachymeterRing`, `numeralStyle`

Hand polygons are generated by shape-specific functions returning `QVector<QPointF>` in local coordinates (pivot at origin, tip pointing up). The caller rotates and translates to the dial center.

### Activation Flow

1. `MainWindow` monitors all audio sources' `playbackStateChanged` signals
2. When playback stops/pauses, a single-shot `QTimer` starts (5 minute countdown)
3. On timeout, `activateScreenSaver()` calls `screenSaver->start()` (selects random theme, sets clock mode, resets hue) then switches the view stack to index 3
4. Any user input emits `userActivityDetected()`, which triggers `deactivateScreenSaver()` — returns to player view and resets the timer

### Performance

The analog clock is optimized for Raspberry Pi 4:

- **Dial-sized glow buffer**: Glow buffer is sized to the dial bounding box (not full screen), reducing blur work
- **Zero per-frame heap allocations**: Glow buffers pre-allocated as members, reused every frame
- **No full-res intermediate buffer**: Elements painted twice — once to 1/4-size glow buffer (no AA), once directly to screen (with AA)
- **Single blur layer**: Radius 3, 2 passes on the small glow buffer
- **Raw pointer blur**: `bits()`/`constBits()` called once per blur function, stride arithmetic for pixel access

## Configuration

```cpp
// mainwindow.h — screensaver idle timeout
#define SCREENSAVER_TIMEOUT_MS (5 * 60 * 1000)
```

## Testing

1. Build: `make`
2. Run: `./start.sh`
3. Wait for idle timeout (or temporarily reduce `SCREENSAVER_TIMEOUT_MS` for testing)
4. Dismiss (click or keypress), wait again — will get a different random theme
5. 7 possible themes: Luxury, Aviator, Diver, Minimalist, Chronograph, Neon Retro (analog), Digital
